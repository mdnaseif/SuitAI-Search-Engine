# SuitAI-Search-Engine

SuitAI-Search-Engine is an innovative AI-powered search engine designed to revolutionize e-commerce by integrating advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) technologies.

## Project Overview

This project aims to enhance the e-commerce search experience by:
- Improving search accuracy and fairness
- Integrating multiple data types (text and images)
- Enhancing user experience through personalized recommendations
- Enabling innovative product discoverability

## Key Features

- Advanced image and text analysis for accurate product matching
- Vector database for efficient similarity search
- Personalized recommendation system
- Image captioning using LLaVA model
- Product image generation using Stable Diffusion
- Multimodal search capabilities (text and image inputs)

## Technologies Used

- CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining)
- LLaVA (Large Language and Vision Assistant)
- Stable Diffusion
- Vector Database (ChromaDB)
- Streamlit (for user interface)
